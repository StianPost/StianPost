# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Front-End student at Noroff.

I enjoy coding more than design, but I still got a long way to go.

My skills are more geared towards programming rather than designing and I enjoy learning new tips and tricks.
Right now I am focusing my efforts on learning and mastering JS before going onwards.
